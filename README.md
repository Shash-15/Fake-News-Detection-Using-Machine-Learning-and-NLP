# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-and-NLP
Fake News Detection Using NLP and Machine Learning is a Python-based project that implements a supervised machine learning pipeline to classify news articles as Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing techniques. The system performs data cleaning, text preprocessing including lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization, and feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization. Three machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated using a standard train–test split approach. Model performance is assessed using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports, with Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy of 94%. The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, and spaCy, and is developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment for reproducibility and academic analysis. This repository is intended for educational and research purposes and demonstrates a practical application of machine learning techniques for fake news detection
📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of different supervised machine learning models in detecting fake news. The system uses TF-IDF feature representation and compares the performance of three widely used classifiers:

Logistic Regression

Multinomial Naïve Bayes

Random Forest

The project is implemented in Python using standard machine learning and NLP libraries and is developed as part of an academic study.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of labeled news articles collected from publicly available sources. Each record contains:

News article text

A binary label indicating Fake or Real

The datasets are merged into a single labeled dataset and then split into training and testing sets for supervised learning.

📈 Results Summary

The experimental results show that Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy:

Model	                   Accuracy
Logistic Regression	       94%
Multinomial Naïve Bayes	   91%
Random Forest	             91%

Logistic Regression performed best due to its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional sparse TF-IDF features.
